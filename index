    <h2>About this website:</h2>
    <p>I created this website to be another 
        resource and study aid to guide nursing 
        students through their Health Assessment course during Nursing School. Nursing School content is often cumbersome and it can be hard
    to know where to begin. I created all these materials to help build a foundation of assessment skills, in a clear and concise way.</p>

        <p> Hi! My name is Samantha. I created this website after graduating nursing school and having a large amount of material that I created. I was a Student Supplemental Instructor
            for the Health Assessment course in my nursing program. The 80+ PowerPoints, worksheets, and study guides helped numerous students and improved exam averages amongst students.
            I wanted to continue helping nursing students, while also utilizing and building my HTML/CSS skills, so this website was created!
